TDD and Pair Programming workshop using the game Snake

What is Snake:

- Every tick the snake moves one block forwards in the direction it is facing
- Pressing up makes the snake face North, pressing down South, left West and right East
- When the position of the snake head is equal to that of the food, the snake grows by one block
- When the food is eaten, a new food is placed at a random position
- If the snake collides with itself, it is dead
